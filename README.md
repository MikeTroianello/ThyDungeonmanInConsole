# ThyDungeonmanInConsole

This is a port of the 2004 Homestar Runner text-based RPG Thy Dungeonman. It was built to be run inside the developer's console.

## About

The program is written in JavaScript, which means all commands will have to be a single word in camelCase, and will have parentheses at the end, i.e.:

```
getFlask()
```

## Getting Started

Play the game by opening the developer's console in your browser

For PC:

```
F12 for most browsers
(Control+Shift+C for Chrome)
```

For Mac:

```
Right click and choose "inspect" for Chrome and "inspect element" for Firefox
```

Find the tabs inside the tools, and click the 'Console' tab.

If you are using a different browser, just search "Open developer console

Once you are in the console, enter the command:

```
thyDungeonman()
```
