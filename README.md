# ThyDungeonmanInConsole

This is a port of the 2004 Homestar Runner text-based RPG Thy Dungeonman. It was built to be run inside the developer's console.

## About

The program is written in JavaScript, which means all commands will have to be a single word in camelCase, and will have parentheses at the end, i.e.:

```
getFlask()
```

## Getting Started

Play the game by opening the developer's console in your browser, and entering the command:

```
thyDungeonman()
```

## Acknowledgments

Thanks to the Brothers Chaps for all their dumb animal characters.
